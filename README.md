# The Last of Us: Legacy 
A turn based top-down game coded in Java using JavaFX for GUI. Made for the Programming Lab course.

The Last of Us: Legacy is a single player survival game set in a zombie apocalyptic world.
The game is conducted in a turn based manner, in which each player character receives a specific
number of action points per turn, which they can use to move, attack or cure zombies, or use
special actions.

The player starts off in a 15x15 grid map with just one hero and 10 zombies. The player can
only see the directly adjacent cells next to their pool of heroes. The player then keeps taking
his turn trying to collect vaccines, and cure or kill zombies. The game ends when the player
has collected and used all vaccines or when all heroes have been overwhelmed and defeated by
the zombies.

The player only wins if he has successfully collected and used all vaccines and has 5 or more
heroes alive.
